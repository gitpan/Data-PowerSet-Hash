NAME
    Data::PowerSet::Hash - Power sets of hashes

VERSION
    version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This provides you with a power set (basically all combinational
    iterations) for your hashes. This only does it for hashes, if you want
    them done for arrays, I suggest using Data::PowerSet. Please view the
    *SEE ALSO* section below.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  hash_powerset
    Create a powerset from hash keys.

        use Data::PowerSet::Hash 'hash_powerset';

        my @pset = hash_powerset(
            husband => 'Homer Simpson',
            wife    => 'Marge Simpson',
        );

        # @pset = (
        #     {
        #         husband => 'Homer Simpson',
        #         wife    => 'Marge Simpson',
        #     },
        #     { husband => 'Homer Simpson' },
        #     { wife    => 'Marge Simpson' },
        #     {},
        # )

  EXPORT
   hash_powerset(%hash)
    See documentation for it above.

SEE ALSO
    For arrays, you should check out Data::PowerSet or List::PowerSet.
